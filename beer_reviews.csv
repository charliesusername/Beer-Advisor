0,5.90,,Hagbards Bock,Dagmar Bryggeriet,None provided.,Bocks,0,-,"
Bock is a bottom fermenting lager that generally takes extra months of lagering (cold storage) to smooth out such a strong brew. Bock beer in general is stronger than your typical lager, more of a robust malt character with a dark amber to brown hue. Hop bitterness can be assertive enough to balance, though must not get in the way of the malt flavor, most are only lightly hopped. "
0,4.00,,Femme Fatale Brown Ale,Thirsty Nomad Brewing,None provided.,Brown Ales,0,-,"
Spawned from the Mild Ale tradition, English Brown Ales tend to be maltier and sweeter on the palate, with a somewhat fuller body. Color can range from a medium amber/reddish hue to dark brown. Some versions will lean towards fruity esters, while others tend to be drier with nutty characteristics. Roasty malt notes give this style complexity, but almost every example has both a minimal amount of hop aroma and low degree of hop bitterness. As with most historical English styles, alcohol levels are kept low to promote drinkability. "
0,6.10,,Upland,Beckwith Road Brewing Co.,None provided.,Brown Ales,0,-,"
Roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be of medium intensity in both flavor and aroma for the American brown ale. American-style brown ales have evident low to medium hop flavor and aroma and medium to high hop bitterness. The history of this style dates back to U.S. homebrewers who were inspired by English-style brown ales and porters. It sits in flavor between those British styles and is more bitter than both."
0,6.80,,Weizenbock,Kujawski Browar Regionalny Osowa Góra,None provided.,Bocks,0,-,"
The German-style Weizenbock is a wheat version of a German-Style Bock, or a bigger and beefier Dunkelweizen. Malt mellanoidins and Weizen Ale yeast are the star ingredients. If served with yeast, the appearance may appropriately be very cloudy. With flavors of bready malt and dark fruits like plum, raisin, and grape, this style is low on bitterness and high on carbonation. Balanced clove-like phenols and fruity, banana-like esters produce a well-rounded aroma."
0,7.10,,Bock Off Helles,Resident Brewing Co.,None provided.,Bocks,0,-,"
Also called “Heller Bock” (meaning “Pale Bock”), the German-Style Maibock is paler in color and more hop-centric than traditional Bock beers. A lightly toasted and/or bready malt character is often evident."
0,18.41,,"Dawat 18,41",Cerveza Dawat,None provided.,Bocks,0,-,"
Eisbock is an extremely strong beer with a typical alcohol content well beyond 7 percent ABV. This beer undergoes a freezing process called “freeze distilling” that separates water from the other components (alcohol and sugars) to concentrate these. Because water has a lower freezing point than ethanol, the water freezes, leaving the alcohol liquid. When the water ice is removed, the remaining beer is stronger than before. Eisbock can range from near black to as light as tawny red. Hop bitterness and flavor are mostly cast aside with a big alcohol presence replacing it, which can range from sweet to spicy, and fruity to fusel. Look for a heavy or almost syrupy body with tons of malty flavor."
0,10.00,,Beaufort 10,Spindrift Brewing Co., Limited (brewed once)None provided.,Bocks,0,-,"
“Doppel” meaning “double,” this style is a bigger and stronger version of the lower-gravity German-Style Bock beers. Originally made by monks in Munich, the Doppelbock beer style is very food-friendly and rich in melanoidins reminiscent of toasted bread. Color is copper to dark brown. Malty sweetness is dominant but should not be cloying. Malt character is more reminiscent of fresh and lightly toasted Munich-style malt, more so than caramel or toffee malt. Doppelbocks are full-bodied, and alcoholic strength is on the higher end."
0,6.80,,Twisted Abbot,Hackensack Brewing Company,None provided.,Dark Ales,0,-,"
The Belgian Dubbel is a rich, malty beer with some spicy or phenolic and mild alcoholic characteristics. Not as much fruitiness as a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, but some dark fruit aromas and flavors may be present. Medium amber to deep brown, this style is recognizable for its mild hop bitterness with no lingering hop flavors. A Dubbel is also likely show signs of a sweeter caramel flavor from the use of crystal malt or dark candi sugar. Look for a medium to full body with an expressive carbonation and some dryness in the finish. Traditionally a Trappist ale, many breweries now make similar ""Abbey Dubbels"" to try and emulate the monastic originals (Trappist Westvleteren 8, Westmalle Trappist Dubbel, and Chimay Première)."
0,9.80,,Subsonic B-Stout,Clandestine Brewing Company,None provided.,Dark Ales,0,-,"
Belgian Darks offer a massive range of characters. The colors play within the amber to light brown and even deep garnet range of hues, topped with thick, rocky heads of great retention. Aromas can offer anything from traces of yeast, spices, malt, floral attributes, and on occasion, slightly intoxicating notes. Flavors run the gamut from dry and spiced, to sweet and malty. Most examples of Belgian Dark Ale have a low level of bitterness."
0,4.20,,Dark Passenger,Clandestine Brewing Company,None provided.,Dark Ales,0,-,"
The American black ale is characterized by the perception of caramel malt and dark roasted malt flavor and aroma. Hop bitterness is perceived to be medium-high to high. Hop flavor and aroma are medium-high. Fruity, citrus, piney, floral and herbal character from hops of all origins may contribute to the overall experience. This beer is often called a black IPA or Cascadian dark ale."
0,5.50,,Sticke Altbier,Hop Oast Pub & Brewery,None provided.,Brown Ales,0,-,"
A Düsseldorf specialty, an Altbier is a German-style Brown Ale. The word alt literally translates to ""old"" in German, and traditionally Altbiers are conditioned for a longer than normal periods of time. Other sources note that ""alt"" is derived from the Latin word ""altus,"" which means ""high"" and refers to the rising yeast. Take your pick, but the extended conditioning mellows out this ale's fruitiness and produces an exceptionally smooth, clean, and delicate brew. Its color ranges from amber to dark brown, carbonation is moderate, and while known to express the slightly spicy, herbal character of Noble hops, the key word here is balance. A stronger version brewed less frequently, ""Sticke Alt"" is a maltier and hoppier take on the Altbier."
0,6.60,,Northern English Brown,105 West Brewing Company,None provided.,Brown Ales,0,-,"
The quintessential British session beer, like its name suggests, a Mild is known for its low level of hop character. Similarly, the alcohol content is traditionally very low, too. Colors can range from medium amber to rich brown. Low carbonation with a nearly still, slightly bubbly head and little to no hop aroma. Grainy to toasty malts might be present, but expect some body from the high dextrins produced during brewing. Traditionally Dark Milds were a draft beer made popular in London and the Midlands of England."
0,6.20,,Still Smokin',Bådin Mikrobryggeri,None provided.,Dark Lagers,0,-,"
Rauchbier is an old German beer style with origins in the 1500s from the district of Franconia and the town of Bamberg. Typically dark to amber in color, it shares similarities with Oktoberfestbier. Green malts are dried over an open fire of beechwood, imparting a unique smokiness (""rauch"" is German for smoke) to the final beverage. Expect toasty-rich malt in aroma and flavor, restrained bitterness, low to high smoke flavor, clean fermentation profile, and an attenuated finish. "
0,5.90,,Oktoberfest,Maxline Brewing,None provided.,Dark Lagers,0,-,"
Before refrigeration, it was nearly impossible to brew beer in the summer due to the hot weather and bacterial infections. Brewing ended with the coming of spring, and began again in the fall. Thus, most were brewed in March (Märzen). These beers were kept in cold storage through the spring and summer months, or brewed at a higher gravity, so they'd last longer. Märzenbier is full-bodied, rich, and toasty, with a moderately high alcohol content. Its color can be anywhere from pale gold to medium amber, but is typically some shade of copper. Like other dark lagers, the aroma is driven by malt, not hops. Best enjoyed by the half liter in a Bavarian beer garden. "

Before refrigeration, it was nearly impossible to brew beer in the summer due to the hot weather and bacterial infections. Brewing ended with the coming of spring, and began again in the fall. Thus, most were brewed in March (Märzen). These beers were kept in cold storage through the spring and summer months, or brewed at a higher gravity, so they'd last longer. Märzenbier is full-bodied, rich, and toasty, with a moderately high alcohol content. Its color can be anywhere from pale gold to medium amber, but is typically some shade of copper. Like other dark lagers, the aroma is driven by malt, not hops. Best enjoyed by the half liter in a Bavarian beer garden. "
