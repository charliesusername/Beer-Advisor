Because a well made, well balanced IPA is a work of art, we took our time with this one and added our own local spin onto it. First we needed a substantial malt backbone to not only create the 6.5% abv, but to compliment later lupulin additions. Heavy doses of Munich Malt and Cara malt help to add body, mouthfeel and a touch of sweetness. Canadian wheat malt also lends to the great foam and head retention. 5 different hops are added at 7 different times in this brew, and the majority of the massive, complicated, but delightful hop profile is derived from Columbus and Cascade hops from the kettle boil (bittering, flavor, and aroma additions). The real icing on this masterpiece, however, comes from literally searching the near and far: Brewmaster Derek Luke married Annie Sherman, a Kiwi citizen in late 2011, visiting New Zealand for their honeymoon. Upon return, Derek came back raving of the legendary Motueka hop. Craving to satiate the “near and far desire”, this hop is added in conjunction with Chinook hops grown right here in RI from Ocean State Hop farms during the lengthy dry hopping process. The result: A fantastic IPA 100% produced locally with local hops, yet worldly in its own right!",32,33006

We actually brew a batch of Christmas Ale, then a batch of Elissa IPA and blend them in the fermenter. We add the spices at the end of fermentation.For the 2015 version, we were able to get our hands on a brand new hop, called Snap, which is actually a blend of hops, spices and botanicals. What exactly is in there? We can't say. How do you blend hops with spices and botanicals? We can't say. We can tell you that the new hop, added at the end of fermentation, adds a ginger snap aroma and a complexity that makes Sailing Santa taste like the holidays.Our Sailing Santa is pure, with no additives or preservatives.

Finally, the addition of whole cone hops into the conditioning tank imparts a hops-bursting-out-of-the-glass aroma, rounding out a complete hop sensory experience!",33,32954

He came around the corner and saw something he had never seen before, a very young pygmy owl, approximately an inch in height. The tiny critter sat on the side of the trail with a fly on its head, and stared at Gus. As Gus stared back, he took out his cell phone and snapped a couple of shots.The next day at the brewery, Gus shared the photos of his new friend. We all thought this “itty bitty” owl was pretty cool. So cool in fact, that we decided to post a shot on Facebook and see if the little guy was worthy of having a beer named after him. Based on the comments and likes, the overwhelming response was YES. Seven months later, we’re happy to announce the arrival of Pygmy Owl “Itty Bitty” IPA.Pygmy Owl is an IPA with full fledged hop taste and aroma, yet is remarkably low in alcohol. In fact, it clocks in at only 4.2% ABV. An IPA with full flavor, but without the harsh bitterness.

Jason says: “The brilliant coloration of the leaves combined with a nice growth habit and exceptionally formed cones with abundant lupulin (the repository of all those aromatic oils), resulted in a strikingly beautiful plant.”Working with the legendary hop breeder Gene Probasco, Jason took cuttings and started growing dozens of plants with fellow grower John I. Haas. Tom Nielsen, hop guru with our friends at Sierra Nevada Brewing, helped them figure out that this new hop was indeed delicious in beer. By 2009, the Smith family of B.T. Loftus Ranches were growing some too, and today “HBC 366” occupies about 1.2 acres of land in the Yakima Valley of Washington.And here it is! Brooklyn Scorcher #366 is a hoppy pale ale that’s dry, minerally and fruity on the palate, snappy in the center, and bursting with the citrusy, piney notes that make our new pal 366 so special.",23,41461

A natural process called ""bunging"" creates gentle carbonation, and the practice of dry hopping (adding fresh hops to the brew during aging), revived by Anchor, creates its unique aroma.Liberty Ale® was first brewed to celebrate the bicentennial of Paul Revere’s historic ride.

It’s an extension of our “what-if” mentality, wherein we ask ourselves what would happen if we did things differently in the brewhouse, such as fermenting with a different strain of yeast or, in the case of this beer, incorporating whole-leaf green tea imported from Japan. The answer, embodied in this IPA when we first released it in 2011, was something truly magnificent, delicious and, as proven by the reissued edition you hold in your hand in 2015, worth brewing again. But what if we changed it? Yes, it’s riskier to change something most people thought to be liquid perfection, including our two-time collaborators Bryan Baird of Japan’s Baird Brewing Company and Toshi Ishii, a former Stone brewer and the founder of Guam’s Ishii Brewing Co., but we’ve found that, when approached with cautious curiosity and logic-driven creativity, reward often follows such risk. So, in bringing this IPA back to life, we followed the same recipe developed four years ago, but exchanged Pacifica hops from New Zealand, a hop-growing region that was becoming popular in 2011, for Helga hops from Australia, an area with a burgeoning botanical scene right now. The result is an IPA that’s as bright, herbaceous and bitingly hoppy as the one that’s had our fans requesting its return ever since its depletion from store shelves, but with a modern, hop-driven twist that makes this second draft unique and tasty in its own right.2011 version is 9.2%2015 version is 10.1%2011 used NZ pacifica hops2015 used AU helga hops",465,13240

This year's version is brewed with well over three pounds of hops per barrel in the kettle and another half-pound per barrel of “dry hops” in two additions during conditioning. A revised fermentation program has produced a more traditional Double IPA flavor profile--drier, less malty, more hoppy.We use only American Pacific Northwest hops. Galena hops are added early in the boil for smooth, balanced bitterness. We add Columbus, Centennial and Amarillo later in the boil for flavor, and Columbus, Centennial and Simcoe in the whirlpool for aroma.For even more aroma, we dry-hop with Summit, Columbus, Amarillo and Cascade hops in the conditioning tank, and dry-hop again right before bottling with whole-flower Cascade hops. The result is fruity, floral and complex, with notews of tangerine zest and fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice.Idaho 2-Row Brewers’ Malt and German CaraHell and Vienna malts give this ale its lovely pale copper hue, with flavors of orange marmalade and dried apricots, supported by a strong backbone of hoppy bitterness.",227,21132

For GGGreennn, we pushed those principles to the extreme. The result is a richly hop saturated beer featuring notes of pineapple, guava, dried jackfruit, tropical fruit, and citrus.

Devil’s Backbone, Dogfish Head, Sierra Nevada, Stoudt’s, Lawson’s Finest Liquids, and Trillium collaborated to create one of the festival’s signature beer Pat-Rye-Ot, a pale ale that pays tribute to America’s original homebrewers.

The fascinated brewers: Sean Lawson and JC Tetreault.Lupulin powder is essentially a super concentrated hop product made by flash freezing and then shattering intact hop flowers. In early November, the team experimented with different ways of utilizing the lupulin powder in both the whirlpool and during the dry hop, taking into account beer and wort temperatures, contact time, lupulin powder temperatures, and consistency of the powder.MALT: American 2-Row Barley, English Pale Ale Malt, Flaked Wheat, White Wheat Malt, C-15, Dextrine, DextroseHOPS: Citra Lupulin Powder, Simcoe Lupulin Powder, Mosaic Lupulin Powder, Galaxy, Nelson",45,298

So we hit the books to develop a modern take on that classic idea. We found our answer in an unlikely place: the human tongue. We learned that our palates experience flavor in stages: sweetness at the front and spiciness at the back, and we designed a beer that follows that pattern. The sweetness from the Belgian yeast hits first, and is quickly balanced by a rye-malt spice, leaving you with a clean palate, ready for the next science-y sip.This is our daily drinker, an amber ale for today’s hard workers.

When we began conceptualizing this beer we were looking for the best platform to showcase a relatively new hop called Nelson Sauvin from New Zealand. We first began experimenting with Nelson when we were brewing single hop beers for the 1st annual ” Wolf Among The Seas,” our educational hop experience. We really enjoyed the subtle flavors of gooseberries and sauvignon blanc grapes that characterize this hop, but because the flavors are delicate and require large amounts of hops, we thought the lighter malt bill of a session ale provided the best base on which to build this beer. Maintaining body in such a low ABV beer was very important to us, so we added a large amount of low crystals and flaked oats to our base of Pilsner malt.Malt: Pilsner, Flaked Oats, Cara-pils, Caramel 20Hops: Nelson SauvinYeast: American",30,5808

New malting techniques led to the development of pale malt, a barley malt kilned at low temperatures which contributed very little colour to the finished beer. Hence the birth of Pale Ale, an amber- to copper-coloured ale you could actually see through. Plenty of British Crystal malt in the grist lends this ale its rich colour, its caramel maltiness, and adds the occasional whiff of toffee to the nose. An addition of American and German hops to the kettle at the end of the boil is used to suffuse our Pale Ale with a gently spicy hop finish.",33,37953

The bready, lightly caramel malt complements the hint of fruitiness contributed by the London Ale yeast, making it satisfying and authentic; the perfect flagship beer for Schlafly.Sixteenth century brewers created amber beers by using a form of coal called coke to roast their grains. Coke burns hotter and more steadily than wood without imparting the foul odors from coal. It allowed brewers to produce caramel malts that were paler alternatives to the common brown porters. At about the same time, Flemish migrants introduced hops to English beers and soon this ale became the chosen style of England from the mid-16th century until the end of the 20th century. Today, brewers outside England have adopted the Pale Ale and made it one of the leading styles of the American craft beer movement.",254,38620

During the last few weeks of the stainless steel portion of the fermentation, the smoked figs were added to the beer and allowed to referment.

Well, the beer initially surprised us — not in a good way. After being brewed in early March of 2015 and packaged by April 1st (somewhat appropriately), the beer had some off-aromas that we used words and phrases like “chlorine” and “shrimp shell” to describe. It was palatable beer, but not something we’d tie our reputation to and release. Rather than dumping it down the drain, we knew the beer would change with time because it’s alive and teeming with microbes that would take the beer down different paths over the long run. Now, after eight months since packaging, the beer has indeed changed to the point where we’re excited to release it! Among other attributes, the nose has become quite funky, and a nice, quenching acidity has developed. This batch of Noble King won’t present like previous versions did at the time of release. The herbal hop aroma and relatively clean fermentation profile associated with younger Noble King is long gone. Funk and sourness are more prominent as mentioned. This batch is testament to one of the mantras we have around the brewery, which is “give it more time”. The mixed culture of microbes, not always, but often have a way of resolving a beer in the long run. This aspect of our beer making has resulted in our “new” batch of Noble King being released over nine months after it was brewed.",129,15458

Traditionally brewed by Belgian and French farmers to provide refreshment during harvest. I'm guessing that flavour wasn't a main concern back then; the priority was to provide a beverage that was safe to drink, because water usually wasn't. Never the less, over time they developed a beverage chrarissed by beer geeks of the modern world. The alcohol content was low, so the workers could consume enough to keep hydrated and still perform their job: To load the barn with enough barley for next years brewing season. I bet these hardworking, humble farmers never imagined, that centuries later, their style of brewing would inspire brewers from all over the world. As all our beers, this is a very modern, you might say new world, interpretation of this style. Based on the tradition we have used a French Saison yeast, which provides a plethora of funky, earthy, very ""Belgian"" flavours. From there we have upped the ante a fair bit by doubling the amount of malt, and thereby the alcohol, and loaded the kettle with punchy Nelson Sauvin hops. Unlike the original, this is not a beer meant to be drunk by the gallon. Moderation is the key for full enjoyment of all great beers.",74,15848

The transformation was indeed dramatic! For the first few weeks, the beer was very reminiscent of Live Oak Hefeweizen, and had a lovely clove character. But as time progressed, and native yeast and bacteria became more dominant, the beer became funky and developed barnyard aromas. After two months in the foudre, a tartness began to emerge as lactic acid producing bacteria began to convert organic compounds into organic acids. Finally, Foudreweizen continued to develop more funk and acidity as it matured in bottles, kegs, and casks during the two months prior to release.Foudreweizen was brewed on January 15, 2015 with Austin water, malted barley, malted wheat, and hops at Live Oak Brewing Co. As mentioned, it was fermented at Jester King with Live Oak’s Hefeweizen culture and a host of microorganisms in one of our oak foudres.

Some are born from friendship, some from mutual admiration for each others craft, and some are just from a marketing standpoint. Calabaza Boreal was born from admiration and friendship. When American wild ales first began to surface, for me, Jolly Pumpkin was at the forefront and still is. In 2009, before starting Anchorage Brewing Company, I was given a bottle of Oro de Calabaza from Matt Dinges of the Shelton Brothers when he was visiting for our annual Barleywine Fest. That beer is still one of my favorite beers, and was my inspiration to start Anchorage Brewing Company. After starting the brewery with Shelton representing me, Matt introduced me to Ron Jeffries, the spooky guy behind Jolly Pumpkin. We would chat back and forth about brewing with oak and different techniques we use in our breweries. Eventually, we decided to make a beer together. It has been such a huge honor to create something with someone that has inspired me so much! Well, it turns out that Ron is just a regular person like the rest of us (well maybe not quite normal), and we have become good friends since I traveled to Michigan to brew the Jolly Pumpkin version of this beer. The Anchorage version is the same beer recipe, different primary yeast, and a dosing of Oro de Calabaza right from the barrel to incorporate a bit of the Jolly Pumpkin flavor into the beer.Now its come full circle, first with an inspiring bottle of Oro, now to a collaboration brew with a bit of Oro in the blend.

As with La Vie en Rose, the second refermentation of the fruit results in subtler, more delicate flavors, as compared with the more intense flavors that result from the initial refermentation.Detritivore is fermented using native yeast and bacteria from the Texas Hill Country, but is not spontaneously fermented, as our brewers actively introduce our house blend of saccharomyces, native wild yeast, and souring bacteria to the wort, rather than relying on inoculation by ambient, airborne microorganisms. We brewed 100% spontaneously fermented beer both last winter and the previous winter, but all of this beer is currently aging in oak barrels and has yet to be released.",29,1639

We start the party with malt and a little candy sugar, and then rev it up with two native Australian flavors—startlingly aromatic lemon myrtle leaves, and kicky Tasmanian pepperberries. After fermentation by our house Belgian yeast, the final touch is a light dry-hopping with the Australian hop variety Super Pride of Ringwood.

According to some, it is also the best, even if its characteristic acidity does not please all palates. To offset this acidity, some decided to add sugar to it. Thus faro was born. Adding sugar syrup to lambic was a revelation at the time of Bruegel. (Some even argue that without faro, Bruegel would have been deprived of inspiration and would have remained an ordinary amateur painter whose canvases couldn't even have been sold at a flea market.) Until the 19th century, faro was very prevalent in the Brussels region. Folklore there was frequently associated with it, and the divine liquid flowed like water. Then faro fell into oblivion. It was not until 1978 that our family brought it back to centre stage. Or centre Senne, as you prefer.

Scotland's cold, blustery climate lends itself to the growing of barley and oats, but not to the production of hops, which are almost always added sparingly.The yeast must work at cooler temperatures than is customary for ales, resulting in maltier, cleaner, less fruity or estery, beers. The color often comes from black roasted malt, which imparts some dryness, but because of the lower attenuation and hopping rates, Scottish ales are almost always slightly sweet and incredibly drinkable.Ours was brewed with black roasted barley, biscuit and peat-smoked malt.

Although the rise of light lager beer diminished the sales of wheat beers on both sides of the Atlantic, the sale of wheat beers began to rise after WWII, especially in Southern Germany where a unique ale yeast strain fermented the beer with banana and clove esters.

This north German wheat beer is traditionally brewed and released very fresh. It has a light body from the wheat and refreshingly tart acidity that make it a perfect summer thirst-quencher. Its lemony tartness is provided by a secondary fermentation with lactobacillus, the same microorganism that’s responsible for yogurt’s tang. That tartness increases and improves with age, so the people of Berlin are known to buy extra bottles to bury in their gardens for two years or more.As usual with our Cellar Reserves, we’ve taken a traditional style and added our own twist. In this case we’ve tripled the strength over the traditional beer, which should only increase its aging potential. For the primary fermentation we used a traditional Bavarian hefeweizen yeast that produces soft notes of banana and clove. We followed that with lactobacillus and six months in conditioning to create a complex fruity acidity that compliments the soft sweet malt tones and a unique ale that is both fulfilling and refreshing.",87,41634

The beer will then undergo a spontaneous second fermentation process which, after a few months, will produce the carbon dioxide (CO2) to which this authentic beer owes its carbonation and distinctive foam head.",133,3373

Kriek Lindemans is a good example of that. In order to obtain a beer like no other, we have been adding whole sour cherries to our lambic for generations. Our meeting with American importer Charles Finkel in the 1970s revolutionized the fruit beer segment. Charles convinced us to export our old kriek to the United States by boat. What we had not thought of is that the movement of the waves would reactivate the fermentation process and cause the corks to pop during the trip. It was like something out of The Adventures of Tintin. To prevent that from happening, we therefore developed an alternative production method for our kriek. We use fresh, not from concentrate, unsweetened cherry filtrate which we blend with lambic that is at least one year old before fermenting & macerating for up to 3 days and pasteurizing the whole batch. So the corks don't pop. Due to the use of filtrate and pasteurization, this kriek is sweeter and fruitier than Old Kriek Cuvée René, which undergoes a second fermentation process in the bottle. Thanks to its innovative flavour, it was a resounding success both here in Belgium as well as around the world. Nowadays, it is undoubtedly the reference kriek for consumers.",550,19417

According to other sources, gueuze has its roots in 'gazeux' - the French word for carbonated - since traditional gueuze is a carbonated blend of different lambics.After the Second World War, some lambic brewers devised a new production method. They filtered the beer, added sugar, saturated it (with carbon dioxide) and pasteurised it. This new gueuze, closed with a bottle cap and available in 25 cl bottles, was called capped gueuze.

Wild yeast and different bacteria in the tuns impart unique spicy, fruity, and bright tart characters to the beer. The porous character of the oak also allows air to slowly seep into the beer during aging and this long slow micro-oxidation through the wood smooths out harsh flavors. KMF is the backbone of all of our Barrel Room Collection beers and is blended, at varying amounts, into each of the five Belgian inspired brews that make up this collection. Its wild, funky character creates a new depth and spectrum of complex flavors from earthy and spicy to floral and sweet. To showcase the unique character of this brew, we’re introducing Kosmic Mother Funk Grand Cru this year for the first time. On its own, KMF is tart, funky, and complex with notes of dark fruits, cherry, cocoa & vanilla.

We attempted to capture some of our sensory experience of the barn by adding ingredients found in the attic to the beer. We added bales of hay to the mash and old hops that had spent many months in burlap bags to the boil. Further providing inspiration for Reposé was Bière de Garde, a traditional French farmhouse beer that likely originated out of the stone-walled barns that dot the landscape of northern France. Bière de Garde was historically brewed in fall and winter to take advantage of cooler fermentation temperatures, and aged for months before drinking. Similarly, Reposé was brewed during February of 2014 and slowly fermented for months prior to being blended and packaged in January of 2015. The wort for Reposé was brewed with Texas Hill Country water from our well, malted barley, hay, aged hops, and fresh hops. It was then pitched with Jester King’s unique mixed culture of brewer’s yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the air and wildflowers around our brewery. After an initial fermentation in stainless steel, Reposé was then slowly fermented for months in Brandy barrels we received from France. It is 8.3% alcohol by volume, 12 IBU, has a finishing gravity of 1.004, and was 3.25 pH at the time of bottling. The label art is by Jester King’s Josh Cockrell.",26,2457

The goal was to improve the quality of Belgian beer. The winner was a new style, called ""Belge"". Due to the success in the contest, a number of brewers decided to brew the style and called it ""Speciale Belge"".A ""Speciale Belge"" is pale amber in color (slighly darker than a pilsner) as brewers tried to copy the color of pilsner in a top fermenting ale. Later the color became darker as pilsners became very common to prove that the style is something special.After the second world war, when the quality of life in Belgium increased, several brewers created a ""Speciale Belge"" with a higher alcohol content, called a ""Dubbel Special Belge"".The beer has a big body, high effervescence, and a deep caramel flavor. There's a slight amount of yeast based sourness that creeps in to offer balance, with a flavor that reminds of dates or caramel covered apple.Today the ""Dubbel Speciale Belge"" no longer exists, the current higher gravity beer styles are trappist, abbey ales and so on. Therefore Brouwerij de Glazen Toren decided to recreate this special beer style. """,95,5795

Containing this beast of a beer for long periods in oak barrels--some having previously aged port, wine or whiskey--tames the unleashed malt and fierce hop flavors, melding and mellowing this powerful liquid into an incredible elixir worthy of a brewer's table.Each annual batch of Arctic Devil Barley Wine represents the brewers' resolve to create an intriguing and sought-after barley wine by precisely brewing to well-designed specifications, carefully selecting the type and combination of barrels to use for aging, and meticulously checking the beer as it ages. Distinct nuance and complexity are contributed by the wood's previous tenants, resulting in unique flavor profiles in each batch that continue to change over time.

But we are also “drinks people,” and many inspirations come to us out of the deep and wondrous world of cocktails. While surely invented earlier, the modern cocktail emerged in the 19th century. The original—the ur-cocktail, if you will—was the Old Fashioned. A deceptively simple drink consisting of whiskey, sugar, and bitters (stirred, not shaken), usually with a bit of citrus peel, a good Old Fashioned remains a thing of austere beauty. By the 1860s, some bartenders, Jerry Thomas (aka ""The Professor"") chief among them, became household names in America. A mixologist (believe it or not, the moniker is actually old) looking to make a name for himself would often make a change to an existing cocktail, perhaps adding absinthe, or curaçao, or a dash of maraschino liqueur. This new version would be rakishly referred to as “improved,” as the upstart barman fervently hoped to eclipse his predecessor.Well, we’ve gone this idea one better. We have “improved” the Old Fashioned by making it into a beer. Witness our strong rye beer, suffused with various spices and peels! Wonder at its long blissful rest in WhistlePig Rye Whiskey oak barrels! Marvel at its clever infusions of bitter gentian root and enticing botanicals! And then enjoy, as you are greeted by the silky spice of rye, the firm herbal bitterness, the brightness of citrus, and the sweet warmth of oak. Sit in your favorite chair, surround yourself with your favorite people, and imbibe this, our latest Brooklyn Quarterly Experiment. We can nearly guarantee that you shall feel that your day has, in fact, improved.Style: Barrel-aged rye ale with botanicals & bittersMalts: Glen Eagle Maris Otter, Canadian 2-row, Weyermann Rye, Fawcett Rye, Fawcett Crystal RyeAdditions: Demerara sugar, Belgian candi syrup, bitter orange peel, lemon peel, nutmeg, cinnamon, coriander, bitter gentian root, cloves, and aging in WhistlePig Rye whiskey barrelsYeast: Our House Ale YeastOriginal Gravity: 21° Plato",35,5350

Join our celebration for the beer that changed it all. We did everything but hang up streamers.What’s the buzz about anyway? Bomb! was a mad creation in response to the many complicated brews that required an interpreter to approach. The path to creating this ultimate beer that never planned on taking itself seriously led to many unexpected revelations. It contained almost every ingredient imaginable. It was difficult. It was delicious. It was a free spirit, complex but lending itself to endless possibilities. It became a much loved member of the family, and a representation of our brewing style and how it has evolved. In its original form Bomb! comes close to being a heady, strong dessert in itself. This led to the conclusion that we had exponential possibilities with flavor profiles and aging processes.Because of this, Birthday Bomb! was conceived to celebrate three wonderful years of experimentation and fun loving flavors like the current incarnation with caramel sauce. Made in house by our brewers with nothing but black gloves and a propane tank. The rest is the complex mix of hops and malt with a healthy dose of the signature coffee and spices.",265,640

We started with the base recipe for PM Dawn American Stout, then slightly dialed back the ratio of cold brew Italian Roast from Barrington to allow the heavy dose of Peanut Butter to find it's perfect place in the flavor profile and balance the beer. Peanut Butter PM Dawn presents an opaque black with brown head and lacing. A strong nose of freshly ground peanuts, chocolate peanut butter milkshake and hints of dark plum from the coffee, is followed by a full bodied palate, rich with complementary flavors of roasty coffee, swirling dark chocolate/cocoa and finishes with delicious peanut butter. Peanut Butter PM Dawn conjures memories of one of our favorite early brew-day quick breakfasts: peanut butter toast and coffee.

Our thick, rich version is brewed with plenty of caramel and roasted malts and subtly spiced with Cascade and Super Galena hops. We accentuate the natural smokiness of the brew by adding a small amount of beechwood-smoked malt. At 22.5 degrees starting gravity and 9.5% alcohol by volume, this beer boasts flavors of chocolate and coffee, along with raisins and dried fruit soaked in sherry.Black Cauldron is a strong ale best enjoyed in moderation. Try pairing it with full-flavored grilled or roasted meats. Rich desserts like chocolate cake, truffles, fruit tarts, caramel flan or crème brûlée are all excellent matches.We brew our Black Cauldron Imperial Stout to recognize and honor the women in the history of brewing. Brewing has been women's work since the dawn of civilization. In all ancient cultures, beer was a gift from a goddess, and women maintained status and power through their skills as brewsters. This remains true today in indigenous cultures from Asia to Latin America, Africa to remote villages in Scandinavia. Around the world, women bake bread and brew their own beer.In Europe, the rise of cities brought commercial brewing, as governments realized the potential tax revenue to be had from large breweries. By 1445, the first all-male brewers' guild was established, the campaign against witchcraft burst forth across Europe, and the purge of women from brewing had begun. Beer historian Alan Eames has written that, when an occupation was listed, most of the women burned for witchcraft in Europe were brewsters or alewives.Most of the imagery we associate with witchcraft today originated with the brewster. The large black cauldron bubbling over with foam? A brew kettle, of course. The black cat? Necessary to keep rats out of the grain store. The tall pointed hat? It allowed the brewster to be seen over the heads of taller men in the marketplace. A broom? The symbol of household domesticity, it is still associated with brewing all over the world.Without the work of these women through the ages, it's entirely possible beer would not exist today. To learn more about the role of women in today's brewing industry, visit www.pinkbootssociety.org. For more on the history of brewing, www.grandtetonbrewing.com.With its dark malts, alcohol and unfermented sugars Black Cauldron is ideal for prolonged cellaring.

In the 1840’s, the pilsner style emerged from central Europe to become the world’s most popular style of beer. Like its ancestors, Brooklyn Pilsner is traditionally brewed from the finest German two-row barley malts. German-grown Perle and Hallertauer hops provide a crisp, snappy bitterness and fresh, floral aroma. The flavor of the malt comes through in the finish. We ferment Brooklyn Pilsner at cool temperatures, and then give it a long, gentle maturation (lagering), which results in a beer of superior complexity and smoothness. We believe that you will find there to be none finer. Unlike mass-marketed so-called pilsners, Brooklyn Pilsner does not contain cheap fillers such as corn or rice, nor does it contain any preservatives or stabilizers. Brooklyn Pilsner is the real thing.",510,34696

4.22,10.00,7547,,Ship Wreck Porter,American Imperial Porter,Carton Brewing Company,"Aged 1 year in Brinley Rum barrels.Shipwreck PorterBarrel Aged PorterABV: 10% | IBU: 26 | SRM: 42When our friends and neighbors at Brinley shipped us ten of the barrels used to make their Brinley Gold Shipwreck Rum from their distillery on St. Kitts, we were given the opportunity to create a beer that would take advantage of wood rather than the other way around. We looked to coax complexity out of the marriage of a barrel's soul and a brew's potential, not just to bomb a huge beer with huge flavor. The rum that lives in these barrels for four years integrates its spice to the wood so well that it ends up reminiscent of a Bananas Foster. A sturdy brown honey porter seemed the best host to receive the ghosts from Shipwreck's old home. We started with a base of deep malts looking for notes of coffee and chocolate, then enhanced them with the floral bouquet of local wildflower honey and the preservative strength of 10% ABV while keeping the body sensible. This was put in the casks to meld with the vanilla, wood, and spice notes, toned down by the oxidative effect of a year in the cellar. Drink Shipwreck Porter because a barrel should be so much more than a depth charge.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMRNXQnMTAg&list=UUnN44_ILc3y0x6WbvjLR1Kg",29,2358

It really isn't as crazy as it sounds. 250 years ago virtually all beers were smoked (it's true, Google it!), but with the dawning of the industrial revolution most of the smoke lifted. However, in the German town of Bamberg the flame has quite literally been kept alive and to this day the town’s brewers produce world renowned beers brewed with their own special rauchmalz (beechwood smoked malt).We’ve taken our best porter recipe and added a good measure of that same Bamberg Rauchmalz. The smoke mingles beautifully with the rich, dark roasted chocolate flavours of the porter without being overpowering. Although it pairs extremely well with smoked seafood, barbeques, strong cheeses and hearty stews, its food friendliness isn’t limited to savouries; chocolate and caramel based deserts are great companions too!

The bottom of the kuurna is layered with spruce branches; the needles act as a natural filter and impart resinous oils into the wort. The hollowed-out trunk of the tree also contributes spruce essence and structure from the raw wood. The beer is made of barley & rye malts along with a sparing addition of Goschie Farms Cascade hops and is brewed just a few times per year.  SAHATI is in many ways the very definition of The Ale Apothecary, where complex flavors arrive from the very methods used for production…the result is the process impacts the flavor profile at least as much as the ingredients themselves.",16,1517

Code named project FX, Asahi engineered a highly attenuated, highly carbonated pilsner. The later renamed product, Super Dry began sales on March 17th 1987 and gave birth to the dry beer category. The market success spawned similar competitor products and initiated what was known as the “Dry Wars” in Japan and a brief marketing fad for dry beers internationally. However Asahi has stood the test of time and now years later Super Dry continues it legacy as the world’s premier dry beer. Special Yeast - Asahi # 318 is the proprietary ingredient used to give Super Dry its “dryness”. This special strand of yeast produces high attenuation during fermentation in conjunction with the choice grains.Finest Ingredients – Asahi uses select grains and hops sourced worldwide based on strict criteria to maintain flavor consistency and promote sustainability.

Th­e malt combination commonly used in Irish Red Ales brings a toasted, malty flavor that balances the citrusy and fruity character of the hops.The Levels of Craic: Have you tried our new Irish Red IPA, The Craic? As we prepare for all things Irish for Harpoon St. Pat’s Fest on March 3rd and 4th, we thought it would only be right to give you a little bit more history about the phrase ‘the craic.’ Pronounced just like a drug, crack (crack is whack, btw!), it’s a term for news, gossip, fun, entertainment, and enjoyable conversation. You’ll often hear, “What’s the Craic” in Ireland which is like saying “What’s Happening?” But perhaps our favorite part of the word ‘craic’ is that there are actually 6 levels of craic you can reach (according to IrelandCentral. Check ‘em out: Level One: Good Craic – It’s an okay night out, but nothing to write home about (we don’t know why we mentioned this because honestly, St. Pat’s Fest could never be just at level one – but … the more you know). Level Two: Mighty Craic – It’s obviously a little bit better than good craic, but we still haven’t hit the amazing level. One or two of your friends may have done something a little bit crazy. Hopefully, you caught it on Snapchat.Level Three: Savage Craic – This is getting closer to how we describe St. Pat’s. A great time with your friends; beers flowing, great bands, food, and jokes. You got a number, you gave a number, you get the idea. Level Four: Deadly Craic –This is most likely just before you hear Shipping Up to Boston by the Dropkick Murphy’s (right?). It’s just a step about savage, but not quite the pinnacle moment. Level Five: The craic was ninety – Wait, what? We’ve read that this phrase comes from a famous song by The Dubliners (get your Irish jig on), but essentially it’s the best night ever. Which is what we hope you’ll leave St. Pat’s fest saying. Level Six: Minus Craic – When a night goes terribly wrong. As employee owners, we’ve seen several of our consumers (and friends, to be honest), hit this level. Don’t be that guy! So, now that you know – what level of craic are you looking for this St. Pat’s Fest?!",37,23139

This style is an integral part of brewing history and a predecessor of the straw-colored, light-bodied beers which are the most widely consumed beers in the world today. The lager yeast ferments the beer more slowly and at lower temperatures; it is then stored for maturation. This results in a beer which is more smooth and drinkable.

Dubbel is a logical name for this doubled beer, though it is more often simply called ‘Trappist’. To this day, the 1926 recipe is the basis for Westmalle Dubbel.Westmalle Dubbel: bottle and tapWe are all familiar with Westmalle Dubbel in 33 cl bottles.

The Brewers Association legitimized the style in 2010, when it was added to the Great American Beer Festival guidelines for the first time.﻿",14,17647

It pours a nice mahogany brown color with a fluffy, tan head.As each Christmas Ale recipe evolves, so does its hand drawn packaging, created by long-time Anchor Illustrator Jim Stitt, who has been creating Anchor’s Christmas Ale labels since 1975. Since ancient times, trees have symbolized the winter solstice when the earth, with its seasons, appears born anew. For the 2018 release, Stitt created a brimming Korean Pine Tree for the label.

German doctors often recommend Schwarzbier for nursing mothers. Our Brewmaster, born in Munich, was the beneficiary of just such advice.We have taken the traditional Schwarzbier, intended to be a “session beer” with typically moderate alcohol, and almost doubled its strength to 7.6% alcohol by volume. We brewed our version with a fine balance of crystal and roasted malts and spiced it with noble hops. We fermented 5 O’Clock Shadow at cold temperatures with a select German lager yeast and cold-conditioned it for over four months to create a velvety smooth, easy drinking springtime brew.This German lager pours a deep brown, almost black color with ruby highlights.

Originally released in summer 2012, De Kleine Dood will be available in spring 2013 on draft and in large format bottles.When Central Waters decided to open its brew house for its first collaboration beer, Chicago’s Local Option was the obvious partner in crime. The resulting brainchild, De Kleine Dood - a Belgian inspired Weissenbock – maintains the traditional characteristics of its Bavarian forbearer, with the added complexity of Belgian ale yeast. De Kleine Dood is dark amber in color; maintains a rich, full-bodied mouth-feel augmented by caramel; mild and dark fruit; and vanilla and bourbon aromas as a result of six months of aging on Heaven Hill Barrels.. Rounded out by an unostentatious bourbon-driven aroma from brief bourbon barrel aging, De Kleine Dood is a complex ale, a marriage of distinctive styles, and an orgasmic experience for the taste buds that revel in its glory.",127,5259

Bitch Creek perfectly balances big malt sweetness and robust hop flavor for a full bodied, satisfying mahogany ale. Like the stream for which it is named, our Bitch Creek American Brown Ale is full of character... not for the timid.SpecificationsMalts: Idaho 2-Row malted barley, German Melanoidin, CaraAmber, CaraAroma & CaraMunich Hops: Galena, Chinook, and Centennial.

Now you might be thinking oatmeal, rye, brown ale, India-style; isn’t that a lot to be going on in just one beer? Well yes, it is. But that is the point. Layers. Flavor elements building on and playing off of preceding elements, like a building wave; a growing crescendum of taste bud temptation; a wall of sound expressed through flavor and channeled toward your mouth. This beer isn’t for everyone. In many ways it is more than just a little weird. It certainly doesn’t fit easily into any category. It isn’t a brown ale, not just a brown ale anyway. It certainly isn’t an IPA. Calling it a rye beer would be selling it way short. In the spirit of all great things that are conceived in the moment, but perfected through passionate repetition it started life as an improvisation and grew from there. And it might not be for you. But if the thought of big spicy rye notes, a wallop of a hop punch, multitudinous layers of caramel, sweet malt and a respectable balancing gravity sound intriguing then you might want to wing it and give Improv a try.",179,26569

And what should be in its final form.This is a 12bbl R&D run of what we believe to be the new Working Man's Lunch. The biggest change: a shift from that tricky Weizen yeast to our house ale yeast, as well as some ingredient adjustments to bring out more chocolate notes. WML epitomizes LUNCH. It's a snack beer. It's not intended to be a decadent chocobomb. It's a brown ale with some chocolate in it...an afternoon beer that you can have more than one of.Notes from previous version:A tribute to the Southern tradition of an RC Cola and a MoonPie. We brew this beer with biscuity malts, vanilla, and chocolate nibs from Raleigh's own Escazu Artisan Chocolates. But instead of using a traditional, dry English or Scottish ale yeast, we get zany and brew with a German (Weihenstephan) yeast strain. This lightens up the beer and adds vanilla and banana notes to give it that MoonPie connection. The result is a drinkable ""dark ale"" that, like most of our plow-to-pint beers, doesn't fit neatly into any one particular style. Have your three martinis, Boss Man. We'll take a Working Man's Lunch.",23,38503

Our Maple Pecan is brewed with a combination of pale, munich, biscuit, and caramel malts. Roasted pecans are also added to the brew for a nutty flavor and aroma. We add maple syrup in the brewhouse as well to give the beer a sweet flavor and full body. After fermentation and aging the beer is transferred into the bourbon barrels. It is then aged for another 8 weeks to absorb all of the flavors from the barrels. The result is brown ale that blends the light flavors of nuts, maple syrup, and baking bread from the beer with the warming flavors of wood and vanilla from the bourbon barrels.",37,30848
