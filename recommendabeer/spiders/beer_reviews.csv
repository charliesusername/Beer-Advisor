We couldn’t be more proud of the way this beer’s enormous citrus, passion fruit, and lemony like aromas blend with a bitterness that gives it a recognizable finish. Plus, the well-rounded malt profile balances out the American hops. That’s right, we used American hops to brew this cross of a German Alt/Koelsch. It’s not blasphemy.

Over the summer months, beers were stored, or lagered, in caves and stone cellars. The evolution of Oktoberfest came from the last brews of the year, in March (or Märzen), as these beers would be ready to drink for the Bavarian celebration, “Oktoberfest”.",185,38554
